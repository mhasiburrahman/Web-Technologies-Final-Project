  <h1>E-Commerce System</h1>
  <p>E-commerce means carrying out of business activities through the Internet; a system, where both-offers of sale and their acceptance – are made electronically.</p>
  <p>(1) We can get every information about a thing to be purchased by us on the Internet, rather than going from place to place.

(2) We can place an order on the Internet, after getting the requisite information.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

(3) Some of the goods can be immediately delivered on the computer itself e.g. computer software, air tickets, hotel booking, tapes, C.D., information, old newspapers etc. This is called on-line distribution.

However, some goods cannot be delivered on the computer. For example, if we want to purchase a car, we can place an order on the Internet; but the delivery of the car is not possible on the Internet. The dealer will bring the car to our residence, after sometime. This is called physical delivery of the order.

(4) Payment can be made over the Internet. The buyer can make payment by giving the number of his/her credit card. This system of payment is called Electronic Fund Transfer – EFT.
